# Data Structures and Algorithms

### Project 1

Project 1 consisted of five (5) programming challenges (Task0-Task4) given two (2) datasets and a prompt. I had to solve the given task by writing code in python3, then analyzing the upper bound run time complexity of my solution using Big-O notation.

The individual tasks are in the src folder. The data is in the data folder. Analysis.txt contains the Big-O analysis of my code within each task.
