# Data Structures and Algorithms

### Project 1

This project is my submission for the first project in Udacity's Data Structures and Algorithms Nano Degree. Project 1 consisted of five (5) programming challenges (Task0-Task4) given two (2) datasets and a prompt. I had to solve the given task by writing code in python3, then analyzed the upper bound run time complexity of my solution using Big-O notation.

The individual tasks are in the src folder. The data is in the data folder. Analysis.txt contains the Big-O analysis of my code for each task.
